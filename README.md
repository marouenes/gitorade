# Gitroade

Gitorade is a simple tool for semantically sample your git commits and keep a nice clean
commit history.

sampling git commits means making your life easier.

For example:

* commit feature "your commit message" # commit a feature -> "git commit -m '[feat]: your commit message'"
* commit fix "your commit message" # commit a fix -> "git commit -m '[fix]: your commit message'"
* commit chore "your commit message" # commit a chore -> "git commit -m '[chore]: your commit message'"
* commit docs "your commit message" # commit a docs -> "git commit -m '[docs]: your commit message'"
* commit style "your commit message" # commit a style -> "git commit -m '[style]: your commit message'"
and so on ...
